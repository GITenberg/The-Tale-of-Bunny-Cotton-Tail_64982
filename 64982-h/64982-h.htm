<p><span class="smcap">If little</span> Bunny Cotton-Tail had
not read by candle-light, this story
might never have been written.</p>

<p>One evening Bunny Cotton-Tail
read very late, and he was so
excited over the story he was
reading that he waved one paw
too near the candle, and burned it
sadly. Poor Bunny cried so loud
that all the neighbors heard him,
and came running in to see what
was the matter. Have you ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
cried so loud that you could be
heard next door?</p>

<p>Mother Cotton-Tail tied up the
burned paw in a cabbage leaf and
sent Bunny to bed. And what do
you suppose that comical Bunny did?
He liked the smell of the cabbage
so well, that he ate the leaf all up,
and his poor paw began to hurt
worse than ever.</p>

<p>This time he did not cry, for he
was afraid he would be scolded for
eating the cabbage leaf. He crept
out of bed and ran out of the
house.</p>

<p>Mother Cotton-Tail never allowed
little Bunny to go out late at night,
so now everything seemed very
strange to him. He looked at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
big moon, and he was afraid. He
ran on for some time and he came
to a beautiful garden.</p>

<p>Here he saw more cabbages than
he had ever dreamed of! There
were big cabbages, little cabbages,
and middle-sized cabbages. He was
just going to have a nice meal
when he looked up and saw a very
tall creature waving its arms at
him.</p>

<p>Poor little Bunny was sadly
frightened. He did not know that
this big thing was only a scare-crow.
He had never seen a scare-crow
before, in all his life. But
he had seen men, and his mother
had told him that men did not
like rabbits. Bunny thought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
scare-crow was a man, and he
quickly crept close to a big cabbage,
to hide, and lay quite still for a
while.</p>

<p>Every now and then Bunny
peeped out from among the cabbage
leaves, and there that awful creature
and the moon were, always staring
at him!</p>

<p>By and by, he decided to run
home, and he started off as fast as
his little legs would carry him. But
the moonlight made him dizzy, and
he took the wrong road.</p>

<p>When daylight came, poor little
Bunny Cotton-Tail was far from
home, and soon a hunter came that
way, and caught him. The hunter
put Bunny in his bag and took him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
home for his little boy to play with.
The little boy&#8217;s name was Harold.
When his papa came in with Bunny,
Harold clapped his hands for joy.
Then the whole family gathered
around and made remarks about
poor Bunny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are his ears so long?&#8221;
Harold asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;To keep the flies off,&#8221; answered
Uncle Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have left his tail at
home,&#8221; said big brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks scared. We must build
him a house,&#8221; said papa.</p>

<p>So they all went to work and
made a nice house for Bunny, and
big brother brought him a large leaf
of cabbage to eat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Two big tears rolled down poor
Bunny&#8217;s face, for the cabbage made
him think of his fright in the garden,
and his sore paw, and how he
had left home.</p>

<p>Then Harold took Bunny in his
arms and hugged him, and that
made the poor little rabbit feel
better, and he fell asleep.</p>

<p>When Harold put Bunny back in
his box, he forgot to shut the door.
He never thought that in the morning
his new pet might be gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Late</span> that night Bunny Cotton-Tail
made up his mind to run away.
So he crept out of his little house,
and through a hole in the back
fence, and was off. The great
moon was staring down at him, and
he was very much afraid of the
moon, but he could not go very
fast, for his paw still hurt him and
he limped sadly.</p>

<p>After a while he sat down on a
log to rest, and whom did he see
coming down the road with a wheel-barrow
but Mother Cotton-Tail? She
had been searching all night and
all day for Bunny.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>When Bunny saw his mother he
clapped his paws together so hard
that he hurt his sore one, and he
cried: &#8220;Oh, ma, oh, ma!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother Cotton-Tail did not waste
any words, for Mr. Fox is out in
the woods at night. She just
tumbled Bunny into that old wheel-barrow,
and whisk! they went down
the road; while the big moon
laughed and made a face at them.</p>

<p>When they got home all the
rabbits in the neighborhood stood
around the front gate, and they all
cried: &#8220;Hurrah! welcome home,
Bunny!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunny was so ashamed that he
hung his head and waved his sore
paw feebly. Then his mother took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
him into the house and put him to
bed.</p>

<p>Poor Bunny was so shaken up
by the ride in that wheel-barrow
that he did not sleep very well,
and next day he had to stay at
home with his mother while all
the other rabbits went to a pic-nic.</p>

<p>After supper, when he was sitting
up in a big arm-chair by the
window, whom should he see coming
slowly up the road but his dear
friend Susan Cotton-Tail? Susan
Cotton-Tail walked slowly because
she was very tired. The rabbits
had tramped miles and miles on
that pic-nic.</p>

<p>Susan Cotton-Tail carried something
on her arm. At first Bunny thought it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
was a bag, and then he saw it was a
basket. What do you suppose Susan
Cotton-Tail had in that basket?
She had some nice things that she
had saved for Bunny, from the pic-nic.</p>

<p>When Susan saw Bunny sitting
by the window, she did not stop
to go around to the front door,
as her mother had trained her to
do. She jumped right in through
the window, and took a seat on
the arm of Bunny&#8217;s chair.</p>

<p>Have you ever had to stay at
home from a pic-nic when all the
other children went? And did you
have a dear friend who brought
you some of the good things to
eat? If so, you know just how
Bunny felt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>Susan Cotton-Tail had sandwiches
in that basket, and cabbage leaves
and radishes, and little cookies
cut in the shape of a rabbit. (One
of the mother rabbits had made
these for a joke.)</p>

<p>After a nice visit Susan said she
must go home.</p>

<p>Susan wanted to go and pick
berries next day. Bunny asked his
mother if he might go too, and
she said he might, if he would try
to be a good little rabbit after
this. Bunny promised, and then he
went with Susan to the gate.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day, when Bunny Cotton-Tail
woke up, he heard the
rain pattering against the window
panes. He cried so loud, and his
tears fell so fast, that his little
brother thought the roof was leaking!</p>

<p>Mother Cotton-Tail said it would
do no good to cry about the rain,
and she went to the closet and
brought out a beautiful new silk
umbrella. She had bought it for a
birthday present for Bunny, but she
hated to see Bunny unhappy, so
she said he might go out in the
rain so as to use it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Now, Bunny was not a very
careful little rabbit, so he did not
wait to learn how to open it, but
ran out of the house and down
the road with the umbrella in his
paw. That is the reason you see
him so in the picture. He ran
fast, because he wanted to show
Susan his new present.</p>

<p>Now, wasn&#8217;t it odd that on that
very same morning Susan Cotton-Tail
cried when she saw the rain,
and that her mother gave her a
beautiful new umbrella? But Susan
was a careful rabbit, and learned
how to open and use the umbrella
before she went out.</p>

<p>Susan had left her basket at
Bunny&#8217;s house the night before, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
her mother said she might go after
it. That is the way the two rabbits
happened to meet.</p>

<p>Bunny was delighted when Susan
showed him how to open his umbrella,
and they stood there some
time, talking in the rain. Of course
it was too wet to go for berries,
but they wanted to have some fun,
so they decided to go to Bunny&#8217;s
house and blow soap-bubbles.</p>

<p>On the way home they passed a
nice garden. Farmer Jones was
out working in it that morning.
Bunny wished very much for a bite
of cabbage, so he begged Susan to
come and hide behind the raspberry
bushes, so that they could
nibble something while Farmer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
Jones was not looking. Now Susan
was a good little rabbit, and she
knew that to steal is very wrong,
so she said, &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Susan and Bunny went on
to Bunny&#8217;s house, and here they
blew soap-bubbles all the morning.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day, Bunny went over to
Susan&#8217;s house and found Susan&#8217;s
mother crying, and what do you
suppose had happened? Why, Susan
Cotton-Tail had not come home,
and her mother was afraid she
might be lost.</p>

<p>When Bunny heard the news, he
cried into a little red handkerchief
that he had wrapped around his
sore paw, and he said he wished to
die if Susan Cotton-Tail could not
be found!</p>

<p>Now Bunny knew that old Farmer
Jones hated the sight of even
his little stubby tail, so he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the quickest way for him to die
would be to run over into the
farmer&#8217;s garden.</p>

<p>He told Susan&#8217;s mother good-by,
waved his sore paw feebly, and set
out for the garden. He thought that
if he must die he would eat some
cabbage first, and he was nibbling
away when he heard some one
whisper his name very softly.</p>

<p>At first he thought it was Marie,
Farmer Jones&#8217;s little girl, so he
curled right up close beside a cabbage,
and did not say a word. He
peeped around the cabbage, and he
could see Farmer Jones&#8217;s blue shirt,
and once in a while he could hear
him whistle.</p>

<p>Then he heard a soft little voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
say: &#8220;Bunny, Bunny, Bunny.&#8221; He
looked over by the raspberry bushes,
and what do you suppose he saw?
There was Susan Cotton-Tail, caught
in a trap!</p>

<p>When Bunny saw Susan he forgot
all about Farmer Jones, and
he gave a loud squeal, just the
same kind of a squeal he gave
when he burned his paw. Farmer
Jones came running, and cried: &#8220;Ah,
ha! I have caught the rabbit at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bunny had just time to jump
into a flower pot, and Farmer Jones
found poor Susan in the trap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Farmer Jones, &#8220;I
have caught the naughty rabbit that
eats my cabbages, and I have a
great mind to kill it!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>But he did not kill Susan&mdash;oh,
my, no&mdash;for she just blinked her
eyes and smiled at him. She was
not the least bit afraid; and why
should she have been, when she
had never stolen anything from
Farmer Jones in her life?</p>

<p>Just then Marie came running
out into the garden, and Farmer
Jones said:</p>

<p>&#8220;See, Marie, I have caught the
naughty rabbit that has been eating
my cabbages, and she looks as
though she had never done anything
wrong in her life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the sweet little thing!&#8221; cried
Marie. &#8220;Let me have her for a
pet, and I will put a pretty blue
ribbon around her neck.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>So Marie took Susan up in her
little apron and carried her, very
gently and carefully, into the house.
She made room for the little rabbit
in her doll&#8217;s bed, and there Susan
fell asleep.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> did Bunny Cotton-Tail do
then, do you suppose? He felt so
sorry about Susan that he cried
nearly all day, and he was so
afraid of Farmer Jones now, that
he did not dare to come out of
the flower pot! The flower pot had
rolled over on one side, so he was
quite hidden.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Marie had
a nice flower-bed in front of the
house, and a friend had given her
a new plant to set out. So she
began to look for a flower pot to
cover it. Of course, you can guess
what happened. Marie found Bunny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Cotton-Tail, the flower pot and all!
&#8220;Oh, papa, here is another bunny!
They must be twins,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>Farmer Jones came up, and when
he saw how scared poor little Bunny
looked, he laughed. He said if they
put the two rabbits together, they
could soon tell whether they knew
each other or not. So Marie carried
Bunny into the house.</p>

<p>Susan Cotton-Tail had fallen asleep
in the doll&#8217;s bed, so Marie slipped
Bunny in beside her, and he pretended
to go to sleep, too. Farmer
Jones said this proved that they
knew each other; for if they had
been strange rabbits, they would
have fought.</p>

<p>Night came on, and the big clock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
in the hall struck twelve, and Susan
woke up. She was so delighted to
find Bunny beside her, that she
almost screamed for joy, but Bunny
put one little soft paw over her
mouth, for he was afraid she would
waken some one, and he was already
planning how they could get away
from Farmer Jones&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>He told Susan that he had heard
the cook say she would leave the
pantry window open to keep her
preserves cool, so, if they could
only find the pantry, they might
escape.</p>

<p>Susan listened so eagerly that her
ears flopped on the side of the
doll&#8217;s bed as though she were keeping
time to a tune.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Bunny stole out of bed, and began
to search for the pantry. He told
Susan to wait until he came back
for her.</p>

<p>The moon was not shining, and it
was very dark. Bunny felt his way
along carefully, till he came to the
sitting-room. Here he saw a big
black box, beside a window, and
it looked to him as though the
window were open. Up he jumped
on the box, to make sure, and crash!
he fell on something that played a
tune! The quicker he ran up and
down, the louder the tune was, and
the louder the tune was, the more
scared Bunny was, and the more he
ran up and down.</p>

<p>Farmer Jones waked up and could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
not think what all the noise meant.
He jumped out of bed and ran
down stairs two steps at a time,
with a candle in his hand. He
found Bunny dancing about on the
piano keys, and he laughed till he
cried.</p>

<p>Then he called the whole family
down stairs to see the strange
sight. Everybody laughed and petted
Bunny, and the more they laughed,
the more scared he was, until he
saw Susan peeping around a curtain
at him.</p>

<p>Then he gave one bound for
the open window. Susan followed
him, quick as a flash, and whisk!
the two frightened little rabbits
were racing away down the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
before one of the family could say,
&#8220;Jack Robinson.&#8221;</p>

<p>What Farmer Jones and the
family thought about it I cannot
say, but I can tell you that Susan
and Bunny were very careful never
to go into his garden again.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Susan&#8217;s mother saw Susan,
she laughed and she cried. Then
she put Susan to bed, and there
the poor little rabbit stayed for
a week, and then it was time for
school to begin.</p>

<p>When Bunny&#8217;s mother saw him,
she switched him with a little maple
switch, and sat him up in the corner
until he told the whole story.</p>

<p>Bunny ran away so much, you
see, that his mother was quite used
to it, while Susan was a good rabbit
and had never before run away
from home.</p>

<p>The week passed, and then Bunny&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
mother said Bunny must go to
school. For rabbits have to go to
school if they want to learn anything,
of course!</p>

<p>So she put up a nice little lunch
for Bunny, and gave his coat an
extra brush. She brushed him so
hard that he cried a little, and went
down the road with his dinner pail
on his arm, brushing the tears away
with his sore paw!</p>

<p>Bunny never did like to go to
school very well, so when he stopped
crying, and found that he had
taken the wrong road and was going
into the woods, he was not
sorry at all.</p>

<p>He went on a little way and saw
some squirrels. They seemed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
having a very good time, and
Bunny sat down to watch them at
their play. Then he opened his
basket and began to eat his lunch,
for he was always hungry.</p>

<p>He was so tired then, after his
long tramp, that he fell asleep, and
he never opened his eyes until he
heard a soft &#8220;tinkle, tinkle, tinkle.&#8221;
He opened his eyes, and there stood
Susan Cotton-Tail, smiling at him.</p>

<p>Bunny did not know where he
was, at first, but he rubbed his eyes
hard, and then he asked Susan where
she had got the dear little bell that
hung around her neck. Susan said
it was a reward given her by her
teacher for good behavior. Then
Bunny was sorry that he had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
gone to school, for he liked the
&#8220;tinkle, tinkle&#8221; of that bell.</p>

<p>Susan said that all the rabbits
were out looking for Bunny, and
that they thought him very naughty.</p>

<p>When Bunny got home, he said
that he would go to school now
every day if Susan might stop for
him. It worked well for a week,
then that naughty Bunny got up
early and went down to watch the
little fishes swimming in the brook.
All the rabbits went out to look
for him and found him and took
him home, as before.</p>

<p>That night Mother Cotton-Tail sat
by the fire a long time, thinking.
Presently, she crept softly out of the
house, shutting the door behind her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Now,</span> what do you suppose Mother
Bunny was going to do? She was
going to find Mr. Owl, who is the
wisest creature in the woods. And
why was she going to find Mr.
Owl? Because she wanted to ask
him how to stop Bunny Cotton-Tail
from running away.</p>

<p>Mr. Owl was at home, as usual,
sitting on a branch of an old pine-tree.
When Mother Cotton-Tail told
her story, he blinked his round
eyes and turned his head all the
way around to hide a smile. He had
heard of Bunny Cotton-Tail before.</p>

<p>Mr. Owl did not talk very much;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
wise people never do. So he answered
Mother Cotton-Tail with two
words: &#8220;Mr. Fox.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother Cotton-Tail did not see
what that meant, but Mr. Owl had
no more to say, so she started
slowly homeward.</p>

<p>On the way home she passed Mr.
Fox&#8217;s den. There she saw an old
overcoat of his out on the line.
Then, whisk! jump! as quick as a
wink she had that overcoat down
from the line, and was off, carrying
it over her shoulder.</p>

<p>When she was safely away from
Mr. Fox&#8217;s den, she crept into the
coat, though it was much too big,
and doubled her ears up neatly
inside his cap.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>She looked ahead of her, and
what did she see, coming down the
road, but a little rabbit&mdash;a naughty,
run-away little rabbit? She knew at
once that it was her own Bunny.</p>

<p>Mother Cotton-Tail stood very still
in the shadow of a tree, and when
Bunny came by, she whisked out,
and took him in her arms and
started straight for Mr. Fox&#8217;s den.</p>

<p>Bunny Cotton-Tail was so scared
that he did not say a word, but
he thought he felt his hair turning
gray, and that was a pity for one
so young!</p>

<p>When they got near the den,
Mother Cotton-Tail stopped. Everything
was very still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Bunny,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
go in there, and we will eat you
up, unless you promise never to run
away any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Did Bunny promise? Well, indeed
he did, in a hurry! And Mother
Cotton-Tail told him that all the
foxes knew about it and would
catch him if he ever ran away
again.</p>

<p>Then she gave him a big hug,
which scared him nearly to death.
Think of his being scared when his
own mother hugged him! But you
see, he thought she was Mr. Fox.
Then she let Bunny go, and he ran
straight home.</p>

<p>Mother Cotton-Tail put Mr. Fox&#8217;s
coat back on the line and went
home, too, very happy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Bunny Cotton-Tail never ran away
from home any more. So Mr. Owl
knew what he was talking about,
after all.</p>

<p>Bunny and Susan were always
the best of friends, but whether
his sore paw ever got well or not,
I cannot tell you, for I forgot to
ask him.</p>

Wretched Flea she tells of the home life of a typical Chinese boy, beginning

as a worker on his father&#8217;s tea farm, as a young man attending college,
and his early manhood. All children will be greatly interested in it

<p class="ph2"><i>BLACK BEAUTY</i></p>

<p><b><i>For Third and Fourth Grades.</i></b> The autobiography of a
horse. Black Beauty, in recounting the many incidents of his life,
has given us a series of stories full of interest, danger and excitement,
through all of which is a pathetic plea for the more considerate treatment
of his kind. He tells his story from colthood to old age, and an
interesting one it is. In fact, few stories have equaled it.</p>

<p>Over one million copies have been sold. Our edition is the best
one on the market to-day for the money. The paper is good, the
print large, the binding strong. <b>214 pages. Price, Cloth, 30 cents.
Paper 15 cents.</b></p>


<p class="ph2"><i>COLLIERY JIM</i>: The Autobiography of a Mine Mule.</p>

<p><b><i>For Fourth and Fifth Grades.</i> By Nora Finch.</b> Hundreds
of thousands of &#8220;Black Beauty&#8221; have been sold, and the amount
of good done by the publication of this book is beyond estimate.</p>

<p>Colliery Jim is similar in style and character, but is an account of
a mine mule instead of a horse. The style is much the same. It
begins with his early life in the West, his purchase, and the sending of
him to a coal mine in Pennsylvania. Descriptions are given of the methods
of shipping live stock, suggestions made in reference to the same.</p>

<p>Colliery Jim tells about coal mines, of the methods of mining, and
all the conditions existing at present.</p>

<p>Miss Finch lives in a part of the coal mining district of Pennsylvania
and her work is based on facts. <b>Illustrated. Good type, paper
and print. Cloth. 170 pages. Price, 40 cents.</b></p>


<p class="ph2"><i>DUKE</i></p>

<p><b><i>For Third and Fourth Grades.</i></b> This is a sequel to Black
Beauty, and like it has met with great popularity. It is the story of
Duke, one of the noblest dogs of dog kind. The frolics of Duke and
his merry companions are the delight of all children and make a most
interesting story. The intelligence of this dog is almost human. His
many hairbreadth escapes, his rescues of human life, his noble self-sacrifices,
his wonderful adventures, make him the hero of all dogs,
and render his life human in everything but speech. <b>154 pages.
Price, Cloth, 30 cents. Paper, 15 cents.</b></p>


<p class="ph2"><i>THE STRIKE AT SHANE&#8217;S</i></p>

<p><b>For Third and Fourth Grades.</b> This is a second sequel to
Black Beauty, and is a strong plea for dumb animals. It points a
moral that all should read and fully heed.</p>

<p>It illustrates how an avaricious man in his greed for money can be
misled into the cruel abuse of dumb animals, how retribution overtakes
him in the form of a &#8220;strike&#8221; among the beasts of burden, how he is
finally led to see the error of his way, and how prosperity once more
smiles upon him. <b>96 pages. Price, Cloth, 30 cents. Paper 15 cents.</b></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
